        <h1>Our Story...</h1>
        <p> Our story begins in Tilburg. A group of 4 friends wanted to be famous streamers. <br>
        In the holiday, they created a channel named 'Elite Eternal.' They made 400 subs within <br> 
        2 weeks. Crazy, right? We were feeling great about it. Until, 2023 arrived. Also <br>
        New rules for the 'Coppa' law. That's a law where you are required to say if a video is permitted <br>
        for children to watch. We didn't do this. So our channel was deleted. We tried again, but didn't work. <br>
        We kept going with other channels, until we created an esports team. "Team Starflare" That didn't give any success <br>
        for 1 month. You may think it'll take longer for a small esports channel (We had a youtube Channel) to grow, but we <br>
        posted over 3 times a week. And then, we said, Alright. We're gonna do this professional. So Here we are!
        Hoping to Create Memories. Hoping we can reach something. Together, as a team.</p>
